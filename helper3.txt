# docker compose lets you define and run multiple services
deploy multiple containers where each container may have its different config, you can use docker Compose to do this and manage these containers way more easily

prj03 -no compose
#   create docker network
$ docker network create mongo-network

see all the networks
$  docker network ls

# run mongo db on this network:
docker run -d \
-p 27017:27017 \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \
--name mongodb \
--net mongo-network \  # network name that we created
mongo    # image name(will fetch from hub    

# installing mongo express:
$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password --net mongo-network --name mongo-express -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb mongo-express   

# in order to see basic auth of the mongo database, log the mongo-express container
mongo express needs mongodb to run, so they both are running if you can use mongo-express


prj03 -with compose
basically a file that stores "docker run" commands of containers that are in the same network

$ docker network rm mongo-network
# removes the previously created docker network


$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
# to start the docker compose file
 docker-compose.yaml is the file name
  "up" is needed
 if we dont give name to it, it will generate smth like "{name of the directory of the project}_default" and containers will be { {name of the directory of the project}_{contain name}_{index of usage of that container}

> Ctrl + C
for stopping all the containers of the docker compose

# we can stop those containers by giving the containerID and "docker stop {containerID}" command


$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
stops the containers in the docker-compose file and removes them


# if you delete container, datas are gone so in order to not remove the containers and only stop them, use the following command:
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml stop

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml start
start after it was stoped
